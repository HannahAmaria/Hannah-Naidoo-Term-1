## About the Project

### Project Description

This is a data driven web application
using Node.js and React. I used an API that consist of COVID-19
data. I used this API to dynamically input the information throughout
my web application, and I also used Charts.js to showcase the data
visually.

### Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

## Features and Functionality

### All The recent COVID-19 data

I made use of the COVID19 API's to collect data and implement it into an awesome react experience. 

On the Front Page you'll be able to see all the Cases, deaths and Recoveries worldwide!

On the Comparison page you'll be able to compare data between population, cases, deaths and recoveries filtered by country!

## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project.

### Ideation

## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process

* Utilized React `Charts.JS` dependency for Data visualization
* Implemented Routing with `React-Router v6`.
* API End Point: link Here 
* `Plugin` for this.
* ETC.

#### Highlights

What I enjoyed most about this project was seeing how
react worked and implementing my data dynamically
into the charts. 

#### Challenges

I struggled to find a good API. I also
had issues implementing my API into the project.

### Future Implementation

I could have spent more time on getting
the API to work better. Next term I will 
spend more time looking for a better API.
